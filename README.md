# DustBin – Smart Waste Management System (IoT)

## 📌 Project Overview
DustBin is an IoT-based smart waste management system developed to help municipal councils monitor garbage bins in real time. The system tracks dustbin fill levels and GPS locations and updates the data to a cloud-based web dashboard, enabling efficient waste collection, reduced overflow, and better resource management.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Hardware:** ESP8266 NodeMCU, Ultrasonic Sensor, GPS Module  
- **Programming Languages:** Embedded C/C++, JavaScript  
- **Database:** Firebase Realtime Database  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Networking:** Wi-Fi  
- **Tools:** Arduino IDE, Firebase Console

## ⚙️ System Workflow
1. Ultrasonic sensor measures the fill level of the dustbin.
2. GPS module captures the real-time location of the dustbin.
3. ESP8266 sends the collected data to Firebase using Wi-Fi.
4. Data is displayed live on a web dashboard for monitoring.
5. Municipal authorities can take timely action based on bin status.

## ✨ Key Features
- Real-time dustbin fill-level monitoring  
- Live GPS location tracking  
- Cloud-based data storage using Firebase  
- Web dashboard for easy monitoring  
- Improved waste collection efficiency

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Mobile application for waste collectors  
- Automated alerts when bins are full  
- Route optimization for garbage collection vehicles  
- Data analytics for waste generation patterns
